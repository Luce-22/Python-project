# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This ia a  data analysis and reporting project that tracks global COVID-19 trends, analyzing cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and time.  It involves cleaning and processing real-world data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), generating insights, and visualizing trends.

## Data Source
* Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset: https://docs.owid.io/projects/covid/en/latest/dataset.html

## Objectives of the Project
* Import and clean COVID-19 global data.
* Analyze time trends (cases, deaths, vaccinations).
* Compare metrics across countries/regions.
* Visualize trends with charts and maps.
* Communicate findings in a Jupyter Notebook or PDF report.

## List of Tools and Libraries Used
* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run/View the Project
Download the dataset: owid-covid-data.csv from Our World in Data.

Place it in the same directory as the notebook.

Open the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) in Jupyter or VS Code.

Run the notebook cells sequentially to view the analysis and visualizations.


## Insights or Reflections

The USA consistently reported the highest number of cases and deaths.

India experienced a sharp wave of new cases in mid-2021.

Kenya had the slowest vaccination rollout among the three countries analyzed.

Death rates began to decline as vaccination programs progressed.

Working with real-world data highlighted the importance of data cleaning and visualization in storytelling.
